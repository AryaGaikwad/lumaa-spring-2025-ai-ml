# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Simple Content-Based Recommendation

**Deadline**: Sunday, Feb 23th 11:59 pm PST

---

## Overview

This system generates personalized movie recommendations based on user input. It works by first processing the user’s query and identifying relevant genres from it. The movie dataset is then filtered based on the detected genres to narrow down the options.

To rank the movies, the system calculates similarity scores between the user query and movie descriptions, ensuring the recommendations are closely related to the user’s interests. Additionally, a genre match score is incorporated to further prioritize movies that align with the user’s genre preferences.

If the user specifies a preferred country, the system filters the recommendations to give higher priority to movies from that country. Finally, the system combines the similarity and genre match scores into a weighted score, which is used to rank the movies and return the top recommendations.

This approach combines both content-based filtering and genre-based preferences, providing diverse and relevant movie suggestions based on the user’s input.
